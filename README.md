- Uploaded code for running LDSC on ATAC-seq peaks ("running-ldsc.md")
- Uploaded BED file ("hg19_combined_peaks.tar.gz") containing all peaks used in LDSC analysis. This includes chromosome, start, end, and cell population where the peak came from.
- Uploaded BED file ("mm10_merged_peaks.tar.gz") containing the mm10 merged peak set. This includes chromosome, start, end, and number of cell populations from which the merged became came from.
- Uploaded RMarkdown used to visualize and further analyze LDSC results ("ldsc_R_code.Rmd"). Files produced by this script are also slowly being added to the repo.
