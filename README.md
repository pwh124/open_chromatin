This repsitory will be continuously updated.

## 06-14-2019

As will surely be obvious, this repo was not continuously updated!

A new manuscript with modifed and additional analyses is nearing completion so the smattering of code associated with v1 of the manuscript is now archived in the "v1_archive" directory.

New scripts will be uploaded for the new manuscript shortly! Stay tuned! 

## 10-15-2018
- Added output from "ldsc_R_code.Rmd" including figures 1, 2, S2, and S3

## 10-10-2018
- Uploaded code for running LDSC on ATAC-seq peaks ("running-ldsc.md")
- Uploaded BED file ("hg19_combined_peaks.tar.gz") containing all peaks used in LDSC analysis. This includes chromosome, start, end, and cell population where the peak came from.
- Uploaded BED file ("mm10_merged_peaks.tar.gz") containing the mm10 merged peak set. This includes chromosome, start, end, and number of cell populations from which the merged became came from.
- Uploaded RMarkdown used to visualize and further analyze LDSC results ("ldsc_R_code.Rmd"). Files produced by this script are also slowly being added to the repo.

## 10-01-2018

- Results and logs from LDSC cell type specific analyses ("ldsc_cts_results" and "ldsc_cts_logs", respectively) have been uploaded  
- Logs from LDSC summary statistic munging ("ldsc_sumstats_logs") have been uploaded
