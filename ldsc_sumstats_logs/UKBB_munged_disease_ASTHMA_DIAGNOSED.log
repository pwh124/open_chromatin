Interpreting column names as follows:
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
EAF:	Allele frequency
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
Beta:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
N:	Sample size

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ../w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from disease_ASTHMA_DIAGNOSED.sumstats.gz into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 12007626 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 10796848 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 14057 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 21969 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 201 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1174551 SNPs remain.
Removed 270 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1174281 SNPs remain).
Removed 0 SNPs with N < 305799.333333 (1174281 SNPs remain).
Median value of Beta was -9.79339e-07, which seems sensible.
Removed 136 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1174145 SNPs remain).
