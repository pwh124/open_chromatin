Interpreting column names as follows:
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
OR:	Odds ratio (1 --> no effect; above 1 --> A1 is risk increasing)
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ../w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from rs_clozuk_pgc2.meta.sumstats.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 8167163 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 7010969 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 11 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1156183 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1156183 SNPs remain).
Using N = 105318.0
Median value of OR was 0.99979, which seems sensible.
Removed 0 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1156183 SNPs remain).
