Inferred that N_cas = 20129.0, N_con = 21524.0 from the FRQ_[A/U] columns.
Interpreting column names as follows:
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
FRQ_U_21524:	Allele frequency
