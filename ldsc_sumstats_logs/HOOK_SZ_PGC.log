Inferred that N_cas = 33640.0, N_con = 43456.0 from the FRQ_[A/U] columns.
Interpreting column names as follows:
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
FRQ_U_43456:	Allele frequency
OR:	Odds ratio (1 --> no effect; above 1 --> A1 is risk increasing)

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ../w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from OR_FILTER_daner_PGC_SCZ49.sh2_mds10_100G-frq_2.sumstat.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 15358464 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 14143234 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 74989 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 16299 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1123942 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1123942 SNPs remain).
Median value of OR was 1.0, which seems sensible.
Removed 0 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1123942 SNPs remain).
