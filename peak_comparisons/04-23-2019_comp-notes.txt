As I am writing the methods section of the paper, I realized that it might be helpful to combine the Roadmap and BOCA data and do the same overlap.

cp boca_atac/boca_processed/merged_boca_neurons.bed .
cp roadmap_dnase/processed_dnase/merged_roadmap_imputed_DNase.bed .
cat merged_* | sort -k1,1 -k2,2n > sorted_roadmap_boca.bed
bedtools merge -i sorted_roadmap_boca.bed > merged_roadmap_boca.bed

# Commands added on to overlaps.sh
combined=/Volumes/PAULHOOK/2019_open-chromatin/human_chromatin/merged_roadmap_boca.bed
mkdir combined_overlap
for i in `ls -v *.bed`; do bedtools jaccard -a $i -b $combined | awk 'NR >1' | cut -f4 > combined_overlap/combined_${i}; done
grep "" combined/*bed > final_combined_overlap.txt
grep "" combined_overlap/*bed > final_combined_overlap.txt
