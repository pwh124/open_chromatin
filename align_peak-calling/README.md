In each README in each section, I will give a brief description of the scripts, inputs, and outputs for each analysis

- _2019_peak_paper.Rmd_: This script union analyzes the peak count matrix created from the peaks called from mm10 ATAC-seq alignment for the 25 mouse cell populations analyzed. The inputs are a count matrix ("2019_peak-counts.txt") and count summary file ("2019_peak-counts.txt.summary") as output by the Subread _featureCount_ program as well as a the GC content of each peak ("2019_gc.bed")
