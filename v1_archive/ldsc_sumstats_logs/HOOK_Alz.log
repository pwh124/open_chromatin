Interpreting column names as follows:
Effect_allele:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
MarkerName:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
Beta:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
Pvalue:	p-Value
Non_Effect_allele:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ../w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from IGAP_stage_1.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
WARNING: 2 SNPs had P outside of (0,1]. The P column may be mislabeled.
Read 7055881 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 5905651 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 2 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 6 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1150222 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1150222 SNPs remain).
Using N = 74046.0
Median value of Beta was 0.0011, which seems sensible.
Removed 22 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1150200 SNPs remain).
