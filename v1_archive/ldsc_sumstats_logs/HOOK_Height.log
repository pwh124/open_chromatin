Interpreting column names as follows:
MarkerName:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
b:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
Allele2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
Allele1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
N:	Sample size
p:	p-Value

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ../w_hm3.snplist

Reading sumstats from GIANT_HEIGHT_Wood_et_al_2014_publicrelease_HapMapCeuFreq.txt.gz into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 2550858 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 1457725 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 7 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1093126 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1093126 SNPs remain).
Removed 32659 SNPs with N < 168790.0 (1060467 SNPs remain).
Median value of b was 0.0, which seems sensible.
