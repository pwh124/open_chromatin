# From the paper: 
# All cohort-level analyses were restricted to individuals of European ancestry that #passed the quality control of the cohort and for whom EduYears was measured at an age of #at least 30.

#Details on cohort-level phenotype measures, genotyping, imputation, association analyses #and quality-control filters are described in Supplementary Tables 16â€“19.

# However no imputation statistics are provided. In supplemental note, they filter out SNPs INFO < 0.3 but no other information provided. Therefore I will merge with alleles. Also need N.

# In ReadMe: Sample Size = 766,345
