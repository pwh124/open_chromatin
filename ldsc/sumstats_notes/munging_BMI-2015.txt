- This is a more updated GWAS from what is used from Alkes Price

# This file contains a signed sumstats. From GIANT website:
# Allele1: The first allele (hg19 + strand). Where the regression coefficients (betas) are # provided, the first allele is the effect allele. Where betas are not provided (typically # the 2010 data), the first allele is the trait-increasing allele.

# So no need to use --a1-inc

# It does not have an INFO column so I will merge with the snplist that Bulik suggests (https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Heritability-and-Genetic-Correlation)
